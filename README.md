# incident-report-2
 
## Objective

I will consider a scenario involving a customer of the company that I work for who experiences a security issue when accessing the company’s website. i I will  identify the likely cause of the service interruption. Then, you will explain how the attack occurred and the negative impact it had on the website. You work as a security analyst for a travel agency that advertises sales and promotions on the company’s website. The employees of the company regularly access the company’s sales webpage to search for vacation packages their customers might like. One afternoon, you receive an automated alert from your monitoring system indicating a problem with the web server. You attempt to visit the company’s website, but you receive a connection timeout error message in your browser.
